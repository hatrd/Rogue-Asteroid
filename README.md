# ðŸš€ Rogue Asteroid

> **Built entirely with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** ðŸ¤–

A fast-paced asteroid shooter with roguelike progression, created completely using Claude Code - Anthropic's AI-powered development assistant. This project showcases the power of AI-assisted game development, from initial concept to polished release.

## ðŸŽ® Game Features

- **Roguelike Progression**: Level up and choose from 5 different upgrade paths
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Wave-based asteroid spawning with increasing difficulty  
- **Rich Audio**: Procedural sound effects for shooting, explosions, and power-ups
- **Particle Effects**: Screen shake, thruster trails, and explosion particles
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Detailed ship sprites, animated starfield, and glowing bullets
- **Multiple Control Schemes**: WASD/Arrow keys + Space/Mouse support

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Play

- **Move**: WASD or Arrow Keys (rotate and thrust)
- **Shoot**: Space or Left Mouse Button
- **Special**: M to toggle sound, P to pause, R to restart

Destroy asteroids to gain XP and level up. Choose upgrades wisely to survive longer waves!
